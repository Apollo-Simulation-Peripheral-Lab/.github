# Apollo Simulation Peripheral Lab

Welcome to the Apollo Simulation Peripheral Lab.

## About Us
We are a group of enthusiasts dedicated to creating peripherals for simulating spacecraft used in the Apollo program. Our aim is to provide authentic experiences for enthusiasts, educators, and anyone interested in space exploration history and technology.

## Our Projects
### DSKY Interface Replica
Our first project is to create a replica of the Display and Keyboard (DSKY) interface used in the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC). The DSKY was a critical component of the Apollo spacecraft, facilitating input commands and providing vital information during missions.

Stay tuned for updates on our progress and how you can contribute to this project.

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from individuals interested in space exploration, engineering, or software development. Whether you're a developer, a space history enthusiast, or just curious to learn, there are various ways to get involved:

- **Code Contributions**: Help us develop software for our peripherals or improve existing code.
- **Hardware Development**: Assist in designing and building physical replicas of Apollo spacecraft peripherals.
- **Documentation**: Contribute to our documentation efforts, ensuring that our projects are well-documented and accessible.
- **Testing and Feedback**: Test our projects, provide feedback, and help ensure everything functions as intended.
- **Spread the Word**: Share our projects with friends, colleagues, and fellow space enthusiasts.
